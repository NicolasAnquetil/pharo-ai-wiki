## Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (abbreviated as SVM) are supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification and regression problems. They are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best separates the features into two classes. <!--SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods.-->Suppose that we have a set of points in a two-dimensional feature space, with each of the points belonging to one of two classes. An SVM finds what is known as a separating hyperplane: a hyperplane (a line, in the two-dimensional case) which separates the two classes of points from one another.

Depending on the dataset and how we want to classify it there are three approaches of SVMs: **Hard Margin**, [**Soft Margin**](#soft-margin) and **Kernels**. Since we only have the implementation of Soft Margin approach for the moment, we will expalain only her

## Soft Margin


## Example (maybe remove title)

For example:

Given 20 input vectors
